## Setup

In this project we implement a website to complement the emotional experience of films.
To open the website please install requirements.txt on your virtual environment.
You can start the application by running python app.py in your terminal.

We structured our project into the Section "Model" and "Application".
"Model" includes:
- "images": the FER dataset of Jonathan Oheix, Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset
- "Expression_Recognition.ipynb": the Jupyter Notebook of the used archichecture, that pretrains the model on the dataset, Link: https://github.com/SHAIK-AFSANA/facialemotionrecognizerinrealtime
- "model.h5": our pretrained model

"Application":
- "app.py"
- camera.py"
- "button_toggle.py"
